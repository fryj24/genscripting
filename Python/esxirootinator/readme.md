# At the top of my script you will find -

## vmware_dir = "/mnt/sda5" #<<<<<<<<<<<<<<CHANGE ME HERE

You absolutely must set the correct number after "sda" disk device number that relates to your VMWare OS disk first prior to running the script.

Other important disclaimers -
1. Not supported by Broadcom - VMWare use at your own risk.
2. You have backups right? check your backup software ensure you got something within desired retention window for any possible loss.
3. This script was initially tested Dec 9th on VMWare ESXi 7.0 U1 only its unclear if other older or newer versions will work. Please use/test at your own will.
4. I am not responsible for support or loss if the script affects systems in any way. Proceed with caution.

To do so see steps below, credit to the article I formulated this scrip based on and its respective author Kevin Soltow:
https://www.starwindsoftware.com/blog/forgot-esxi-root-password-no-problems-4-ways-reset/

1. In the terminal su to root.
2. now run fdisk to list out all devices with a grep filter down to /dev/sda only.
Example: fdisk â€“l | grep /dev/sda
3. In the output find the two disks "usually /dev/sda5"  for "Microsoft basic data".
4. Taking note of which "sda" disk numbers are "Microsoft basic data" ls each one to find if it contains a "/etc/shadow" file within if so that is the disk you need!.
Example: ls -l /etc/ | grep shadow
5. Modify the .py file changing the vmware_dir at the top and run the py script wait for success message in the final output usually under a minute to complete.

Special thanks to my colleague Diego Torres for sparking my interst in creating this script and collaborating on its success.
